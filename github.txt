difference between merge and rebase?

ssh to create a authentication key

git add origin master "url"

git status

git add. --to add the untracked files from working rep to local

git commit -m "message"

git push origin master

=====
cat filename --to see file contents
git checkout master --to switch on masterbranch from current branch
ls --to list out current files in repository

Git rebase and merge both integrate changes from one branch into another. Where they differ is how it's done. 
Git rebase moves a feature branch into a master. Git merge adds a new commit, preserving the history.
